# Friending Landing Page

This repository contains the source for the webpage [friending.jrbeverly.me](https://friending.jrbeverly.me/).

The webpage is built off a Jekyll template.

## Theme 

I wanted to use a simple landing page template that included a mobile component in some form. I thought the 'Automatic App Landing Page' would be a good fit, as it had front and center. The theme is designed as below:

> A Jekyll theme for automatically generating and deploying landing page sites for mobile apps. https://emilbaehr.github.io/automaticâ€¦

The theme is by [Emil Baehr](https://emilbaehr.com/) pulled from [github/emilbaehr/automatic-app-landing-page](https://github.com/emilbaehr/automatic-app-landing-page)
