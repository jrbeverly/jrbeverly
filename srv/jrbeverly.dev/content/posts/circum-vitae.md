# jrbeverly.circum.vitae

## Summary

This is a data repository for the circum.vitae of Jonathan Beverly (jrbeverly - i.e. me). The CV is provided as a single `.json` file (available minimized), that can be used in webpages (such as a online resume).

## Description

The repository splits the circum vitae into a series of smaller files written in json. The files are then stitched together by `gulp` based on the project specification (`project.json`). The project does not try to encompass all projects or initiatives, but instead focuses on storing relevant projects for a circum vitae.

The compiled dataset can be used in a webpage or even cross-compiled to another data format.

The full scope of all projects or initiatives are unlikely to be included completely in this data repository.
