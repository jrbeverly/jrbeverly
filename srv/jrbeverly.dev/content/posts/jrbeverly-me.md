# jrbeverly.me

## Summary

This project represents the compiled static webiste that is jrbeverly.me.

**Note: This is now marked deprecated and will no longer match jrbeverly.me moving forward.**

## Getting Started

The site is a static site that is a manual composition of multiple other repositories (`portfolio`, `profile`, etc). As this repository is only a storage repository for the compiled static webpage, you can simply open `index.html` in a browser.

The idea for this repository at the current time was to provide:

* A mechanism of references (jrbeverly.me/ref/) that would act similar to a link shortener. This would allow projects to move more freely as they had an anchor point at `jrbeverly.me/ref/<anchor>`.
* A simple HTML brief that describes a repository (for all selected repositories)
* A list of projects of relevance
* A homepage acting as a portal to other online identities
